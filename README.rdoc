== TWENT-FOUR

The game is {TWENTY-FOUR}[https://twenty-four-on-react.herokuapp.com/], a 2 or more player game. The goal of this game is to get the highest SUM possible. The catch is you must roll AT LEAST one  and one  for you to be able to count the rest of your roll. The highest possible roll is a [2][4] | [6][6][6][6], which is equal to TWENTY-FOUR. If you don't roll the required [2] & [4], your score is ZERO. You get at most 6 total rolls, however after each roll you must keep at least ONE die.
